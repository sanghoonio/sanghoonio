**Land Rover Discovery**

After the self-help craze of the late 2010s and early 2020s, it seems like both self-help and self-improvement are finally starting to be seen as cliche. This was a given, but I still don't see people consider or explain why. The simple reason is that people have less control over things than they believe or want to believe. 

- Can you control your odds of winning the lottery? no.
- Can you control what motivates you? no.
- Can you control what upsets you? no.
- Can you control who you like, dislike, or are attracted to? no.
- Can you control what bores you to death? no.
- Can you control how others respond to you and whether they like you? no.

So what do you really have control over? The conclusive answer, in my view, is nothing, in the vacuum of your own lived experiences and current circumstances. Is there anything you can do about this? Maybe, maybe not. But what can help is better understanding. Understanding really what your odds of winning the lottery are. Understanding what it is about winning the lottery, a goal you wish to achieve, or someone who attracts you that motivates you. Understanding how you'd feel if you tried winning the lottery 1000 times and never won. Often, gaining this understanding requires experience, and you will seek answers to questions you personally want to know the answers to and feel able to try answering. What cannot give you answers is blindly following the advice of or formulas prescribed by random strangers completely removed from your circumstances. By doing so, you are not even asking your own questions. All you really need, is your own permission to honestly consider what life has to offer you today. As long as you can understand that, self-help becomes clearly an illusion.
