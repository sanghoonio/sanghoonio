**DiscoveryMaxxing**

Self-help and self-improvement have been fairly popular to advocate for for a long time, but they are inherently shallow concepts. Why? They are result-oriented, and often prescribed for people who feel they don't have the means to achieve the outcomes they desire, or for those who need to told what to do to become "better". The method is to follow formulaic behaviors that are socially accepted "improvements" over what they might be doing currently, and the hope is that maxxing out on these patterns better guarantees desired outcomes. Nothing could be further from the truth. Following the crowd to achieve things you personally desire is the definition of giving up your agency and connection to outcomes. It no longer really becomes your achievement if you don't take the time to explore why you want to pursue something and how you might get there, or supplant your exploration with optimization grifts thought of by others removed from your lived experiences. If you are unwilling to take the time to deeply understand through personal discovery what it might take to reach your own goals yourself, are the goals really that important to you? Actions should be taken for the sake of discovering outcomes, not in an attempt to fulfill unlikely results out of expectation. The first can only deepen your understanding of your condition, while the second sets you up for disappointment towards both the result and process, lowering your capacity for future exploration.
