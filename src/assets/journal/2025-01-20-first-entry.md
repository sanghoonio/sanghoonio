**What did we witness today?**

- I redesigned this webpage and added a journal feature
- Trump's inauguration
- Elon's emotional intelligence and love of Roman culture
- TikTok was considered a national security threat and a curse on our attention spans. With Trump's immediate reversal of the ban and subsequent censoring of anything anti-Trump, it seems TikTok is as pro-MAGA as Douyin is pro-CCP. With Trump's grip on all major US social media platforms, when will we start seeing Trump's cult of personality codified in our society?
