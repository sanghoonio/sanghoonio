**Maintain Posture, Slow Down**

Sometimes I practice at the golf range. Every time I do, I notice several things. 

- I top the ball probably a third of the time.
- I chunk into the ground like an excavator for maybe half of that. 
- When I hit the ball true without slicing or topping, the ball actually goes pretty far. It makes me proud of using clubs that are older than me.
- There is always a guy burning through his bucket without stopping to prep or think about his next shot.
- I cringe internally at the guy practicing haphazardly. So I slow down more myself, though I already try to hit slowly most of the time, and actually do reduce my error rate. 

The first two points are a matter of maintaining posture as you hit the ball. Topping the ball comes from not keeping your head down and standing taller both with your back and legs on the downswing. Standing up like that obviously moves the club face higher relative to the ball, so stop straightening up as you hit the ball. It's a bad habit to have, even if it might be from over-adjusting against chunking or getting used to hitting with too high of a tee on the mat with your driver. Head down. Stop standing.

The last two points involve something I've noticed about human behavior in general. It's very hard to notice where you're going wrong without having someone else demonstrate it to you, whether it's them making the same mistakes as you or them showing you how it's done correctly. Even if they aren't interacting with you at all, it's always easier to practice at the range with someone else in another stall because being able to even passively notice what to do or what not to do (more often the case as you get better) is very useful. But this goes for other aspects of life as well, like socializing. The most effective way for you to learn better social skills, in my honest view, is to interact with people who annoy you. Trial and error helps if others provide feedback, but you'll never truly understand why something you do might annoy someone else without actually experiencing the triggers yourself. Obviously, having an example of what to do correctly is very helpful for establishing a foundation, but for correcting learned mistakes, it seems the punishment of experiencing the mistake yourself is a better motivator than any reward you might get from hoping you are following the example correctly.
