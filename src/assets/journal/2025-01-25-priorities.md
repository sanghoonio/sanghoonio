**Current Priorities**

I'm finding that building web apps and interfaces is what I'm most passionate about career-wise, but...
- it's hard to build a thought-provoking portfolio that doesn't consist of YouTube tutorial copypastas
- focusing too much on the idea can hinder skill development – especially if it's too complicated for beginner devs
- building simple projects that have been done before for the sake of practice is boring or unimpressive

What can I do?
- like a lot of people in their 20s, I can spend less time doomscrolling and being unable to focus
- be open to new experiences – people, places, things – to help with passive brainstorming
- start with simple ideas instead of dismissing them too early, and then think of ways to add personal improvements or combine them in interesting ways
- accept and acknowledge small steps as a part of learning and general experience
