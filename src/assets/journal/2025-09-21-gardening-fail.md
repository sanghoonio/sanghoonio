**Excessive Treatment**

Occasionally when I discover pest infestations or rot on my plants I go overboard with treatment and end up severely damaging or killing the entire plant. A few years ago over winter it happened with a neem oil spray where I burned most of the leaves off of some jade plants that had mealybugs on them. A few months back I killed a fenestraria that was in bloom by pouring straight 70% isopropyl alcohol onto the plant across a couple days when I discovered it had mealybugs. I thought it would work because this worked for me previously as a less destructive treatment for jade plants and other succulents compared to neem oil. But the alcohol caused this one to dry out from the roots and die completely. Given that there was no rot, the plant probably absorbed the alcohol through its roots and dried out from the inside. I probably didn't need to pour it into the plant several times in a row.

More recently I found some leaves on my pings were starting to rot, which was probably a reaction to a combination of stagnant reservoir water, overheating of the environment I put them in, and some excessive algae, fungal, or bacterial growth on the soil grit surface resulting from that. Given what I learned from the alcohol earlier this year and how I usually add some hydrogen peroxide to the water reservoir to keep it clean, I thought I might as well just pour some hydrogen peroxide onto the pings themselves to ensure the rot doesn't continue. The problem was, because I usually bottom water my pings and there was so much algae or biofilm growth on the soil surface, the hydrogen peroxide was not getting absorbed into the soil quickly and just submerging the pings for a while. At the time, I thought this was fine but I ended up losing probably 2/3 of my pings over the next few days. Only a few pings had rotting leaves in the first place, so this hydrogen peroxide treatment was probably uncalled for.
