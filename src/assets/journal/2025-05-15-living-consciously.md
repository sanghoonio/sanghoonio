**Turn off FSD**

It's very easy in this age to just coast by without thinking much. Content feeds already know what you might be interested in, so you won't have to look things up yourself. Chatbots often provide you better answers than Google and Stack Overflow without judging you for asking a dumb or wrong question. There is always work to be done to distract yourself from thinking deeper about what you want out of life. Things are just given to you and it's very easy to just keep things as they are, because nothing explicitly threatens your existence as long as you have a decently paying job. Things that are emotionally heavy can just be numbed out because boredom no longer really exists. Escapism and fantasy are likely reality for a considerable number of people. But I want to stress to myself that the key to getting more out of life is to live consciously. Planning rigorously day to day isn't really necessary in my view, but having a firm grasp of how you're feeling day to day, and what you do, or can do, to influence such feelings is important in maintaining a genuine appetite for life. I wrote something about determinism several months ago and stand by it, but we mortals don't really have the means to predict every aspect of the future. Circumstances can always change and surprises are everywhere, if you let yourself experience them.


Something I feel I am very autopilot about in particular is what I expect from people. Sometimes I can be dismissive of fine people around me I don't yet feel much connection to, and for others my internal feelings for them can be obsessive if I admire things about them.
